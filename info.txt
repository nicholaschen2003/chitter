  https://stackabuse.com/recursive-model-relationships-in-django/
  REPLIES WORK??????????? REFORMAT POST VIEWS AND CHANGE SPECIFIC VIEW TEMPLATES TO DISPLAY REPLIES CORRECTLY??????
  REPLYING_TO OF POST IS NONE, REPLYING_TO OF REPLY IS THE POST/REPLY IT IS REPLYING TO (POST OBJECT/MODEL)

Link things to places (signin should have link to sign up, etc.)
Lots of styling to do (pfp, lining up Reply Retweet and Like, etc.)
Add static images now that pfps are not static
Followers (bio page?)
Make things that require login redirect back to the "next" page in url (sent via GET)
